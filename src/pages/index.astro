          I would like to share with you a bit of who I am inside and outside
          work. One of my main hobbies is doing sport, almost any kind of sport
          climbing, swimming, running, cycling and so on. I am a strong believer
          of having a well balanced life because if I include every day a bit of
          exercise, a proper sleep and good quality food, I can perform 100% to
          my capacity and what is even more important, happier. As far as I
          know, the way to achieve that balance is by being disciplined.

          Also, I reckon that you shouldn't be defined by your profession, your
          definition should be much more complex. That is why I not only
          consider myself as a Fullstack Software Engineer, I am also
          professional barista and head baker of my home &#128521; &#x1F609;
